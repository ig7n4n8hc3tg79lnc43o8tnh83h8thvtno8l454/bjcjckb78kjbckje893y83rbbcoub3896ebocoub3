##### Solution Design Document (SDD)
It is an in-depth documentation of the solution details and ==solution blueprint that is represented in an end-to-end flow diagram== showing all the solution elements that are envisioned and agreed to be leveraged moving forward.

##### Business Requirement Document (BRD)
After the SDD is prepared, you should revisit this document, to ==ensure that all the business processes and sub-processes covered==, and all the requirements (functional and non-functional) addressed.

##### Ensure all documents are SMART
It should clearly describe the project objectives in a ==SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Repeatable, and Time bound)== format.

##### Project plan
It is a ==road map document on how to achieve the objectives== in the implementation phases. It must facilitate a concise and effective communication. The project plan must define the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), which identifies all the work that needs to be done to complete the project.

##### Communication plan
The plan should ==formally define who should be given what specific information== and when the information should be delivered.

##### Quality and acceptance plan
This plan secure the ==acceptance of the deliverables and identifies the external dependencies==, as these may directly or indirectly impact the project plan.

##### Change management plan
You need to ==capture the change request in a== log, with adequate information to answer questions to why, whom, what, who, where and when.

##### The fit-gap review
The fit-gap document is the ==primary input document to write the FDD==. It is very important to review the fit-gap document in detail before starting with the FDD.

##### Functional Design Document (FDD)
This document ==describes the features of the desired customizations==. The document can include things such as flowcharts, screenshots, wire frames, and will contain an organized list of requirements that can be used for development, testing, and client sign off.

##### Technical design document (TDD)
After the functional design document is completed and signed off, the development team needs to start writing a technical design document. It includes ==information about the programmatic approach of how a particular requirement will be implemented==. TDDs are prepared primarily by the developer for the final development.
